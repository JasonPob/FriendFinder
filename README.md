# Celebrity Friend Finder - Node and Express Servers

  

In this assignment we created an full stack JavaScript application that surveys the users personality and matches them to a celebrity who shares a similar score. 

The user is prompted with ten questions which the are required to answer using a 1-5 scoring system. The results are then added and then compared to results taken by celebrities. Once the survey is submitted, your celebrity match will appear showing their name and a picture of what they look like!

This app is deployable thanks to Heroku!
